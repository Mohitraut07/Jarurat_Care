# Number Manipulation Web App

Welcome to the Number Manipulation Web App! This application is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations on a number with additional features like progress tracking and undo/redo functionality.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Two buttons allow you to add or subtract 1 from the current number.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar reflects the current value of the number relative to a maximum value of 150.
- **Undo/Redo**: Easily undo or redo your last operation to revert to a previous state.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Vercel
